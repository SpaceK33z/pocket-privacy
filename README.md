# Pocket Privacy Edition

This is a Chrome extension for [Pocket](https://getpocket.com). I really like Pocket, but I don't want it to be able to track every website I browse to.

This is heavily inspired by [pocket-mini](https://github.com/evmar/pocket-mini), but it does not need an access token for accessing Pocket.

At the moment it is not published at the Chrome extension store, if there is interest in this, please open an issue.
