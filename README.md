# Pocket Privacy Edition

This is a Chrome extension for [Pocket](https://getpocket.com). I really like Pocket, but I don't want it to be able to track every website I browse to.

This is heavily inspired by [pocket-mini](https://github.com/evmar/pocket-mini), but it does not need an access token for accessing Pocket.

This extension is available one the [**Chrome Web Store**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket-privacy-ed/foggicgimbemdljifmnlandgnknipibf).
